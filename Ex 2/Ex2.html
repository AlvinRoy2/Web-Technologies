    <p>Argentina captain Lionel Messi was named as the best player at the 2022 FIFA World Cup after leading his team to the famous trophy.
        
        Messi took home the Golden Ball award after beating Kylian Mbappe and Luka Modric in a vote among FIFA-appointed experts.

        The 35-year-old almost left Qatar with the Golden Boot too. But he was denied that gong in the 118th minute of Sunday's epic final when Mbappe completed a hat-trick to take his tournament tally to eight goals.
        
        Messi finished the tournament with seven goals and three assists in his seven appearances.
        He was one of only three Argentina players to play in every single minute of their campaign - 690 in total after two games went to extra time.
        In those 690 minutes, Messi made 347 passes, five tackles and attempted 32 shots.

        <p>Lionel Messi led Argentina to ultimate glory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and fellow forward Angel di Maria, in a recent interaction, revealed how their skipper gave an inspirational team talk as he skipped his pre-match ritual.
            Di Maria, who scored and provided an assist in the final, explained how he used to perform his pre-match rituals ahead of all important games but did not do so before the finale.
            “When I put on the shirt, I usually start praying. I have my Jesus there, my Virgin Mary, my cross, and on my phone, I have a photo of my wife and my daughters.
             I always light a candle but the final …,” Di Maria told journalist Sofi Martinez Mateos.Within the Argentine National Team, the true talisman of titles has a name: Ángel Di María.
             The midfielder is really the player who always makes a difference for Argentina in the Finals and as proof he has scored in four of the decisive duels won by his country.
             Di María scored a goal in the World Cup Final in Qatar after a great play that was crowned with an extraordinary goal. El Fideo made it 2-0 before 45 minutes against France at the Lusail Stadium.

    <h2 style="font-size: 50px; text-decoration: underline; margin-bottom: 2%;">Julian Alvarez</h2>
    <p class="Julian-text">Julian Alvarez has now scored four goals in the FIFA World Cup, one behind golden boot leaders Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.
        With surging runs and a striker’s instinct, Julián Álvarez carried Argentina into another World Cup final. Lionel Messi and the 22-year-old Álvarez were a pair of 5-feet-6 (1.70-meter) predators in a partnership that put to rest any hopes Croatia had of reaching back-to-back finals. (More Football News)

The younger of the pair rose to the challenge on soccer’s biggest stage with a huge performance on Tuesday, earning a penalty kick converted by the 35-year-old Messi before scoring twice to maybe even outshine his teammate — one of the greatest players the game has ever seen — in a 3-0 victory at Lusail Stadium.

Álvarez became the youngest player to score twice in a World Cup semifinal match since a 17-year-old Pele scored a hat trick for Brazil in 1958.

No wonder Messi held Álvarez in a playful headlock after his first goal and hugged him hard after the second.

“The match from Julian was excellent, not only because he scored two goals, but because he helped our midfielders,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. ”He showcased an excellent game for his age.”
Álvarez now has four goals — not bad for a player who didn’t even make the starting lineup until Argentina’s third game in the group stage.

He will surely be by Messi’s side again on Sunday when they return to Lusail Stadium for the final.
